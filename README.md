 Mid Term Project code for DIGF-2B03-Physical-Computing class at OCAD U
 The project is a rounded board with LEDs and Sensors in which you have to interact with the sensors to go to next levels
 Every new level, the speed of the game increases.
 
 Base code for sensors:
 
 Photo Sensor - http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Calibration
 Force Sensor - http://learn.adafruit.com/force-sensitive-resistor-fsr/using-an-fsr
 Push Button - Arduino CookBook 5.1 Using a Switch
